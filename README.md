OdinProject Assignment to create a website for recipes

## Goals

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the learned skills and concepts during the first lessons of the odin project.
Specifically it's about:

- HTML Pages
- HTML Elements
- Lists
- Links

Afterwards I will have created my first own website for recipes.
