    <h2>How to make Chicken Noodle Casserole</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>The first step is to preheat the oven by 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then place a large pot of water over the high heat and bring it 
            to a boil. Cook the egg noodles for 8 minutes until they're slightly undercooked. They'll finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>
            The second step is to saute the onions and garlic in a medium skillet over medium heat with some olive oil.
        Once tender, pour them into a medium mixing bowl along with the frozen veggies.
        </li>
        <li>
            The third step is to add both cans of soup, milk, and chicken broth to a large mixing bowl. Whisk that together until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            The fourth step is to add the chicken, noodles, and veggies to the bowl with the soup mixture and stir to combine. Season it with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            The fifth step is then to spread the noodle mixture into an even layer in a greased 9-inch x 13-inch baking dish.
        Bake for 25 minutes until the top is slightly golden and the sauce is bubbling.
